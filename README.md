## Description

This is just a small project intended for me to get a bit familiar with the Godot Engine. 
I used AccuWeather's API for the actual weather data. Considering that with the free API you get 50 API calls per 24 hours, 
the program is made to call once every hour for current and 12 hours of hourly forecasts data. It also does a call every 12 hours for 5 days of daily forecasts.
The window is set to render at 30FPS to not waste more resources than needed.

### Instructions on getting it set up
1. Make an account on AccuWeather API website _https://developer.accuweather.com/_
2. Go to __My Apps__ and make an app 
3. Take the given API and paste it in the text box you see when you first start the Weather App
5. Voila
